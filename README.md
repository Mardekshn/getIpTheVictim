# getIpTheVictim

To run this project, follow these steps: First, you have to get hosting, even if it is free. In this case, I recommend 000webhost or any other hosting, no problem.  Second, you have to create an index.php file in your free hosting, then copy the code in the ipvDekshn file and paste it into the index.php file.  Third, choose any link you want to phish your victim with, an example. I will put the YouTube link as an example for testing, then save the file after modifying it by placing a link of my choice...focus a little!  Now, my friend, take the link to your site from the free hosting and shorten it if you want, of course!  In this case, I advise you to use the bitly website or something else. This is according to your convenience, of course, and finally, my friend, send the link to your victim. When the link opens, you will find in your hosting below the index.php file you will find a new file called ip.txt Finished... A simple trick when accessing  The stage of choosing the link that you will send to the victim, try to find out the interests of the victim, for example, he is interested in BTS, football, basketball, eating, cooking, etc. etc. etc.. Well that's it.
